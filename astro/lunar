Based on research of stock market data since 1950, we have identified a “Lunar green period”,
when stocks tend to do better than average, and a “Lunar red period”,
when stocks generally underperform.

Green periods start about 3 days after Full Moon,
and
red periods begin about 3 days after New Moon.

The out performance in green periods is significant, as you can see in this chart (1950 – 2009):

This basic strategy of being long during lunar green periods has continued to work well

We base it on the most basic strategy:
buying stocks at the end of red period and selling them at the end of green period
