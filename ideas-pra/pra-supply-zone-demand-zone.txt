stock falls - ppl are willing to sell at lower
stock goes sideline - ppl are selling low, but not beyond a certain level
accumulation phase - ppl keep selling in low range and buyer keep absorbing it
 - sooner or later sell volume begin to dry up
rising phase - to draw volume, one has to offer higher price, hence price begin to rise


price would rise if
 - to buy same average volume there is no supply on that same price (supply dry up on that price level)
    - low volume price up - invalid
    - same volume price up - valid
 - to buy additional volume there has to pay extra price (demand rise up beyond that price level)
    - high volume price up - VALID
(here ideally RSI also should have begin to rise)
it can be double confirmed by Hakin-Ashi as well
