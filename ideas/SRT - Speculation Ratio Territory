Speculation Ratio Territory

It is used to find the Index Top or Bottom which will define the buying and selling zone.

It should be checked on a weekly chart.

Example : As Nifty Trades around 248 days in a year.

So, 248/2 = 124

Now Use 124 DSMA on weekly chart.

Suppose Nifty 124 DSMA is @16000 and Current Market Price is 16500, then

SRT = 16500/16000 = 1.031

Top SRT of Nifty = 1.55

Bottom SRT of Nifty = 0.55

One should start investing when SRT value is between 0.55 to 0.75

And exit when SRT value is between 1.30 to 1.55

    0.55 to 0.75 --> ENTER (Green Zone)
    0.75 to 1.30 --> HOLD (Blue Zone)
    1.30 to 1.55 --> EXIT (Red Zone)
